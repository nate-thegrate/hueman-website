  <h3>What's so great about</h3>
  <h1>"open source"?</h1>

  <p>
    An open-source project doesn't just share a cool app,
    it also shares <b>how</b> the app was made.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can download and play this game, and you can also head over to the
    <a href="https://github.com/nate-thegrate/hueman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      hueman GitHub page
    </a>
    to look at the source code.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's difficult for an open-source project to make money:
    <br>
    if you try to use advertisements or in-app purchases,
    anyone can just copy the source code,
    get rid of the ads & paywalls, and re-release it for free.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    But there's a whole lot that makes open-source great:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>It's educational!</b>
      If you see something cool and wonder "how did they do that?",
      just go to the source and see for yourself.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Get free help!</b>
      There are a lot of games with wonderful modding communities,
      filled with passionate people who make the experience better for everyone,
      without even being paid.
      When you're 100% open source, it's that much easier
      for your creation to grow and develop in beautiful ways.
    </li>
    <p>and, most importantlyâ€¦</p>
    <li>
      <b>Virtue signaling!</b>
      In the software world, there's no better way to shout "I'm a good person"
      than by creating and supporting these projects.
      There's an immense level of satisfaction that can only come from
      contributing to something larger than yourself.
    </li>
  </ul>
