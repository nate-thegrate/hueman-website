  <h1>Summer (the color!)</h1>

  <p>Summer is a vibrant color with a hue of 90 degrees.</p>

  <p>
    "Spring green" is a lot like regular green, but the color's a bit <span id="cooler">cooler</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, "summer green" is like normal green, but a bit <span id="warmer">warmer</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spring has a hue of 150°, and the oranges and browns we see in the autumn have a hue close to 30°.
    And at 90°, summer sits right at the midpoint between them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chartreuse is both a gross name and a gross color.
    And before "summer", we didn't have any other names for the midpoint between yellow and green,
    so we used the same name to describe both the dull color and the fully vibrant yellow-green.
  </p>

  <h3>No longer shall this be the case.</h3>

  <p>
    When you play HUEman, you'll get the ability to change every instance of the name "chartreuse" to "summer"
    as a reward for reaching rank 500 in "tense" mode.
